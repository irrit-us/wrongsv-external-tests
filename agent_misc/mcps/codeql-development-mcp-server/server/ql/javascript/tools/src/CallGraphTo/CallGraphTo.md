# CallGraphTo for JavaScript

Displays calls made to a specified function, showing the call graph inbound to the target function.

## Overview

This query identifies all call sites that invoke a named function, producing an inbound call graph. Given a target function name, it reports each caller and call location, which is useful for understanding how a function is used across the codebase.

The query accepts function names via an external predicate (`targetFunction`).

## Use Cases

This query is primarily used for:

- Finding all callers of a specific function
- Impact analysis before modifying a function signature
- Understanding usage patterns and entry points

## Example

The following JavaScript code demonstrates inbound calls to `targetFunc`:

```javascript
function targetFunc() {} // Target function for analysis

function caller1() {
  targetFunc();
}
function caller2() {
  targetFunc();
}
```

Running with `targetFunction = "targetFunc"` produces results showing each call site with the message pattern ``Call to `targetFunc` from `caller1``.

## Output Format

The query is a `@kind problem` query producing rows of:

- ``select call, "Call to `target` from `caller`"``
