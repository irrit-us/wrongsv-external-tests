##
## Test: Server must start successfully when CODEQL_PATH points to a valid
## CodeQL binary, even when codeql is NOT on PATH.
##
## Usage:
##   ./server/scripts/test-codeql-path-valid.sh <codeql-binary> [<server-bundle>]
##
## Arguments:
##   <codeql-binary>  Absolute path to a valid CodeQL CLI binary
##   <server-bundle>  Path to the server JS bundle (default: server/dist/codeql-development-mcp-server.js)
##
## Environment:
##   CLEAN_PATH  Optional. When set, PATH is replaced with this value so that
##               codeql is not discoverable via PATH. When unset, the current
##               PATH is used as-is (useful for local testing).
##
## Exit codes:
##   0  Server started successfully and was shut down cleanly
##   1  Server failed to start or exited prematurely
##
